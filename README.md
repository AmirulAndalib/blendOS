### `blend` and `akshara`

`blend` and `akshara` are the primary components of blendOS, that handle immutability, updates, overlays and containers. Both of them are written in Python.

The `blend` repository also contains 'blendOS Settings', a GUI configuration tool for blendOS that uses Electron.

### Infrastructure

Quoting our announcement on the blendOS Discord Server.

> We're ready with a huge update to blendOS. However, it has increased requirements for infrastructure, due to the development of a new, innovative update system.
>
> We currently host our ISOs on SourceForge and Google Drive, but that would not be possible for the next release due to technical reasons. We do have the necessary infrastructure for building ISOs, but do not have the capacity to host them ourselves at the moment.
>
> We would greatly appreciate it if you have a spare VPS (or an old computer collecting dust) lying around that you could provide for hosting ISOs, with sufficient bandwidth. We plan for the build server to automatically upload generated ISOs to such servers, depending on the availability of free space as well as bandwidth constraints.
>
> This is really essential for any future releases, hence the ping.
>
> Feel free to post information about any available hardware/VPSs for hosting ISOs in the ‚Å†#infrastructure channel, as well as any provider suggestions that offer servers for this purpose at reasonable rates, since I'll be funding it from my pocket.
